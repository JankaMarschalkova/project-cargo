# Project CarGo

The `CarGo` app is designed to respond to the needs of people who travel medium to long distances and wish to **share their ride** with others heading in the same direction. The app allows users to create a profile, enter their starting point and destination, and search for potential carpooling partners based on location and route. This approach is **cost-effective** for passengers and drivers and simplifies **environmentally friendly** travel.

The CarGo app offers a user-friendly interface and a range of features to enhance the carpooling experience. Here are some additional details about the app:

* **User profile:** Users can create or edit a personalized profile within the app, providing relevant information such as their username, nickname, age, gender, phone number, car or any aditional note. Profiles help build trust and facilitate communication between carpooling partners. 
The profile of driver is also seen while clicking on the driver name at ride preview.

* **Ride Creation:** Users can easily publish a new ride by entering their leaving from and going to point, along with the date and time of travel. As a driver, they can specify the number of available seats in their vehicle and the price per person in â‚¬. This information helps match drivers with suitable passengers.

* **Search and Match:** Passengers can search for available rides based on their desired route and travel time. The app employs an algorithm to suggest potential matches, considering factors such as location and time proximity and it filters the appropriate rides from Firebase database. 

* **Real-Time Status Updates:** Users can view the current status of their own rides, as well as those they have joined. The app provides real-time updates on ride confirmations, cancellations, and any changes in the ride schedule. 
This app also allows user cancel ride. In case of driver it allows cancel ride as well.

* **Environmental Impact:** CarGo promotes environmentally friendly travel by encouraging the sharing of rides and reducing the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road. By maximizing vehicle occupancy, the app helps decrease traffic congestion and minimize carbon emissions.
