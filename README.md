# Project CarGo

The `CarGo` app is designed to respond to the needs of people who travel medium to long distances and wish to **share their ride** with others heading in the same direction. The app allows users to create a profile, enter their starting point and destination, and search for potential carpooling partners based on location and route. This approach is **cost-effective** for passengers and drivers and simplifies **environmentally friendly** travel.
